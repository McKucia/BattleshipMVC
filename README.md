# Battleship game
* Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players.
* It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet 
of ships (including battleships) are marked.
* The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. 
* Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, 
and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
